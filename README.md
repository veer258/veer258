### Hi, I'm Veer!👋🏼

I'm a Student, Tech Enthusiast, Digital Artist, and Programmer with an eye for creativity.

I am best at making websites and web apps and making scripts using Python.
Aside from programming, I like photography, shooting tech-focused YouTube videos and making digital art for my Instagram page.
